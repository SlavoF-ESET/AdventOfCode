My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions

This is just me learning Python, so if you really are going to look at the code, please have mercy ;)

If you are actually going to try to run the code provided here, please note this:

- The solution is always in a file, and should be run with the latest python3. I assume that input is read from the file input.txt, which is in the same directory as the program that reads it, and output is written to the file output.txt, which is in the same directory as the program that writes it. All repo is in the same .venv virtual environment.
